# About Me ðŸ‘‹
### Hello / HallÃ¥ / Hi / Ù…Ø±Ø­Ø¨Ù‹Ø§ :

I am Azam, my bread, butter & passion has been data ever since I bought my first computer back in 1992. Whether itâ€™s defining a variable or applying statistical hypothesis or ML based predictive modeling., You will probably find me connecting the dots.

Over the past 15 years, I have honed my technical and business knowledge within the IT and telecommunications sector. Technology inspires me and data being the new fuel led me to pave my career into the field of data sciences, statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

While I bring expertise in areas such as business analysis and design, SCRUM Agile methodology, software development and design life cycle (SDLC), UML, DFD, ERD design techniques, revenue assurance, sales planning and performance, and solution architect billing/business support systems (BSS), I am now seeking to further develop my skills in the exciting and evolving fields of data science, statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various different technologies/domains: Data warehouse, Data Science, Data Wrangling
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning, but currently my interest revolves around Advance Statistics, Machine Learning & artificial Intelligence
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on knowldege sharing, code sharing and building better AI models
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with real-time ML
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Telco, Data Science, Computer Sciences, Hikining, Rowing
